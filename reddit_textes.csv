3	Wow, that’s very cool.  To think how keen their senses must be to recognize and avoid each other and their territories.  Plus, I like to think that there’s one from the white colored clan who just goes way into the other territories because, well, he’s a badass.	reddit

But actually beautiful, not ""here's a graph of my heart rate when I went on a date."" This is actually gorgeous, informative, and awesome."	reddit
17	I want more data!!! Is the white pack made up of many aggressive wolves so they spread to other territories periodically? Or is it just the one wolf who doesn’t give as much of a fuck? Does a tighter cluster mean a smaller pack or just more territorial? What is the age, gender, and type of wolves that are being tracked?! So many questions, so little information. 	reddit

25	"It's content like this that makes reddit great, well done OP.     
    
This is a window into the mind of a wolf. Not only do they have clearly defined ranges, they have clearly defined packs and each wolf must know each other's scent markings. I am blown away.     
    
Also the blue pack is way too cautious."	reddit
26	I found the location on Google Maps. It looks like the green pack's territory covers about 25 sq. miles (larger than San Marino) and also includes the NOvA Far Detector: [https://www.burnsmcd.com/projects/nova-far-detector](https://www.burnsmcd.com/projects/nova-far-detector)	reddit

57	DNA analysis of markings and droppings to go with this?  Would be nice to compare in 10 years to see if there is some intermingling.	reddit
58	Even their travelling patterns vary. For example the red pack has covered most of their defined territory that they don't stray from where as the white pack tends to push the boundaries of their territory.	reddit
59	and then the fire nation attacked	reddit
60	Makes sense. I very rarely go into other people’s homes as well.	reddit
61	"Curious why the white and pink groups have so much ""open area""?  My guess is that their territory has less ""usable"" land.  Maybe a gorge or something.  
This thought brought me to the question?  Does each ""pack"" have the same territory as far as usable land?  
The two largest territories are the white and pink, yet they have the most ""unused"" land?
If each territory is equal in usable land, what would dictate this?  Are the packs the same in number?  Or is it because of dominance and fighting among the different packs?
Please tell me there isn't a wolf counsel the decides....gerrymandering."	reddit
62	"I find it interesting how there doesn't seem to a centralized or preferred spot, but rather the entire territory is relatively evenly covered. You'd think they'd have preferred hunting grounds or game trails or something like that, but I guess not. 

edit* actually it looks like Yellow at least has a central hub, but Red is almost completely even. I wonder if the streaks of density are game trails or part of a defined route for grazing animals they prey on. There's an obvious strait line streakiness here and straight lines tend to be uncommon in nature."	reddit

409	"I think this is certainly convincing evidence for the presence of territoriality among pack animals, including humans, but I'd argue it's different to equate that directly to national boundaries. National boundaries aren't based in the same intuitive, biologically-palpable markers, and can be quite defined quite arbitrarily. Will humans innately know they've crossed into another country if there were no signs, border posts or other markers to indicate it? It can be difficult even to know when we've crossed a county line, or even across private property lines. Signs and border posts are the human equivalents of scent markings, of course - but then if there are no signs, would we even notice the border?

So I think we can say that we have an innate tendency to be territorial, but the exact scale and nature of those territorial boundaries are extremely flexible for us. We're not reliant on physical scent marking, but on highly abstract social processes. The countries we have today would not at all have been intuitive or sensible to humans living 3000 years ago - the idea that communities could exist on such a scale would seem ludicrous. Hell, people in the 13 Colonies did not at all think of each other as living within the same community just because they lived within the same federal country line. But generations pass, narratives are created, and presto, the 13 Colonies become the USA, not just administratively, but intuitively and socially. So it's something that ultimately can be immensely flexible."	reddit
